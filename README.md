# Juttle InfluxDB Adapter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/juttle/juttle-influx-adapter.svg?token=C2AjzxBQoVUrmWXFQb7w)](https://travis-ci.com/juttle/juttle-influx-adapter)

Juttle InfluxDB adapter for the [Juttle data flow
language](https://github.com/juttle/juttle), with read & write support. Large
part of InfluxQL SELECT syntax is accessible through options and raw mode is
also available as a fallback.

Currently supports InfluxDB 0.9.0.

## Examples

Display all entries from the `cpu` measurement:

```juttle
read influx -db 'test' -measurements 'cpu' | view logger
```

Write a single point into the `cpu` measurement:

```juttle
emit -points [{ value: 0.01 }] | write influx -db 'test' -measurement 'cpu'
```

## Installation

Like Juttle itself, the adapter is installed as a npm package. Both Juttle and
the adapter need to be installed side-by-side:

```bash
$ npm install juttle
$ npm install juttle-influx-adapter
```

## Configuration

The adapter needs to be registered and configured so that it can be used from
within Juttle. To do so, add the following to your `~/.juttle/config.json` file:

```json
{
    "adapters": {
        "influx-adapter": {
            "url": "http://localhost:8086/"
        }
    }
}
```

The URL in the `url` key points to the API url of your InfluxDB instance.

## Usage

When storing points, the following conventions are used:

1. All fields whose values are strings are treated as
   [tags](https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/concepts/key_concepts.html#tag-key).
   You can always override this behavior using the `valueFields` option: For
   example, `... | write influx -valueFields 'foo', 'bar'` will treat `foo` and
   `bar` as fields, not tags.

2. InfluxDB distinguishes between integers and floating point numeric types. By
   default, the adapter stores all numeric fields as floats. This can be changed
   by enumerating the integer fields via `intFields` option.

### Read options

Name | Type | Required | Description
-----|------|----------|-------------
`db`   | string | yes | database to use
`raw`  | string | no  | send a raw InfluxQL query to InfluxDB
`mesurements` | array | no | measurements to query, defaults to all measurements
`offset` | integer| no | record offset
`limit`  | integer | no | query limit, defaults to 10000 records
`measurementField` | string | no | if specified, measurement name will be saved in a point field with this name
`from` | moment | no | select points after this time (inclusive)
`to`   | moment | no | select points before this time (exclusive)

### Write options

Name | Type | Required | Description
-----|------|----------|-------------
`db`   | string | yes | database to use
`intFields` | array | no | lists fields to be stored as integers instead of floats (default: none)
`valFields` | array | no | lists fields to be stored as values instead of tags (default: all non-string fields)
`measurement` | string | yes | measurement to use (required; optional if points contain measurement field as specified by the `measurementField` option)
`measurementField` | string | no | points will be checked for this field and its value will be used as the measurement name
